There should be a gitignored directory named tweeta or tweetapus, or similar. This contains the source code for the tweetapus social media platform, in which this program is a desktop application for.
If there is no such directory and you need reference data, ask the user to download the directory, or download it from https://github.com/tweetapus/tweetapus.
Each time you make a major change, update the test suite to cover this.
